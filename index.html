		<h3 style="text-align: center">solving Project Euler problems by hand</h3>
		<p>This site is an attempt to solve and explain the solution of as many <a href="projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> problems using only math and possibly a calculator (but only for simple calculations) and sometimes the internet. Many Project Euler problems can be easily solved with simple computer programs, so let's do it the hard way.</p>
		
		<p>Publishing the solutions of problems beyond the first 100 problems isn't allowed, but I doubt I'll even make it that far.</p>


		<h2 id="problem-1"><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=1">1.- Multiples of 3 or 5</a></h2>
		<p>If we list all the natural numbers below \(10\) that are multiples of \(3\) or \(5\), we get \(3,5,6\) and \(9\). The sum of these multiples is \(23\).</p>
		<p>Find the sum of all the multiples of \(3\) or \(5\) below \(1000\).</p>

		<details>
			<summary>Solution</summary>
			<p>The sum of the first \(n\) numbers is given by the triangular number formula
			<p>\[ 1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \sum_{k=1}^n k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}. \]</p>
			<p>Then we can easily find the sum of the first \(n\) numbers that are multiples of \(m\) by using</p>
			<p>\[ m + 2m + \cdots + nm = m (1 + 2 + \cdots + n) = m \sum_{k=1}^n k = \frac{m n (n+1)}{2}. \]</p>
			<p>In order to find the sum of multiples of \(3\) and \(5\) below \(1000\), we will find the sum of the multiples of \(3\) below \(1000\) and the sum of multiples of \(5\) below \(1000\). We will have double counted the multiples of \(3\) and \(5\), which are exactly the multiples of \(3 \cdot 5 = 15\), so we will "uncount" these once by substracting the sum of multiples of \(15\) below \(1000\).</p>
			<p>There are \( \lceil 1000 / 3 \rceil - 1 = 333 \) multiples of \(3\) below \(1000\), \( \lceil 1000 / 5 \rceil - 1 = 199 \) multiples of \(5\) below \(1000\) and \( \lceil 1000 / 15 \rceil - 1 = 66 \) multiples of \(15\) below \(1000\). We ceil and substract one from this division because we are interested in the numbers strictly below \(1000\). If we only floored this division, we would get \( \lfloor 1000 / 5 \rfloor = 200 \) multiples of 5 below \(1000\), which is taking \(1000\) into account.</p>
			
			<p>Therefore, the sums of multiples of 3, 5 and 15 are, respectively,</p>
			<p>\[ \frac{3 \cdot 333 \cdot 334}{2} = 166833, \quad \frac{5 \cdot 199 \cdot 200}{2} = 99500, \quad \frac{15 \cdot 66 \cdot 67}{2} = 33165, \]</p>
			<p>so the final answer is \(166833+99500-33165 = 233168\).</p>

		<h2 id="problem-2"><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=2">2.- Even Fibonacci Numbers</a></h2>
		<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with \(1\) and \(2\), the first \(10\) terms will be:</p>
		<p>\[1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,\dots\]</p>
		<p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>
		
		<details>
			<summary>Solution</summary>		
			<p>If the \(n\)-th term of the Fibonacci sequence is denoted as \(F_n\), the sum of the terms of the Fibonacci sequence from the \(a\)-th term to the \(b\)-th term, including these, is given by</p>
			<p>\[ \sum_{n=a}^b F_n = F_{b+2} - F_{a+1}. \]</p>
			A proof of this identity can be found in this <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1211909/sum-of-fibonacci-numbers">stack exchange post</a>. We are interested in only the even terms. However, the parity of the Fibonacci numbers follow a pattern that will help us here.</p>
			<p>Instead of how the problem statement suggests, let's assume that the first and second Fibonacci term are \(F_1 = 1\) and \(F_2 = 1\). Then we have the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first two Fibonacci numbers are odd, therefore, the third Fibonacci number is \(F_3 = F_1 + F_2 = 1+1 = 2\), which is even since it's the sum of two odd numbers.
				<li>The fourth Fibonacci number is \( F_4 = 1+2 = 3 \), which is odd since it's the sum of an even and an odd.
				<li>The fifth Fibonacci number is \( F_5 = 2+3 = 5 \), which is odd since it's the sum of an odd and an even.
				<li>The sixth Fibonacci number is \( F_6 = 3+5 = 8 \), which is even since it's the sum of two odd numbers. 
			</ul>
			<p>From here, the pattern repeats and we see that the Fibonacci numbers follow this pattern: odd, odd, even, odd, odd, even, odd, odd, even... Because of this pattern and because each number is the sum of the previous two numbers, we see that the sum of the first \(n\) even numbers is the same as the sum of the odd numbers below those even numbers. For example, the sum of the first three even numbers in the Fibonacci sequence is</p>
			<p>\begin{align*}
				44 & = 2 + 8 + 34 = F_3 + F_6 + F_9 = \\
				   & = F_1 + F_2 + F_4 + F_5 + F_7 + F_8 = 1 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 13 + 21 = 44
			\end{align*}</p>
			<p>We see that the even numbers are at the positions in the Fibonacci sequence that are multiples of three, which will make our notation easier. The sum of the first \(n\) even Fibonacci numbers will be \( E_n := \sum_{k=1}^n F_{3k} \) and the sum of the odd Fibonacci numbers below these even numbers will be \( O_n := \sum_{k=1}^n F_{3k-2} + F_{3k-1} \). Since we have proven that these two are equal, we have that</p>
			<p>\[ E_n = \tfrac{1}{2} (E_n + O_n) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^n F_{3k-2} + F_{3k-1} + F_{3k} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{3n} F_k = \tfrac{1}{2} (F_{3n+2} - F_2). \]</p>
			<p>We know \(F_2 = 1\), so \(E_n = \frac{1}{2} (F_{3n+2} - 1) \). It remains to find how many even numbers are there in the Fibonacci sequence under four million. Notice that \(3n\) is the position of the last even number we are considering, so we just have to find the position of the biggest even number under four million and this position will be \(3n\). Looking at <a href="https://oeis.org/A000045/list">a list of the Fibonacci sequence from the OEIS</a>, we see that this highest even number is \( F_{33} = 3524578 \), while \( F_{34} = 5702887 \) exceeds four million. Then, we have that \( 3n = 33 \); there are 11 even Fibonacci numbers under four million; and the sum we are looking for is</p>
			<p>\[ E_{11} = \tfrac{1}{2} (F_{35} - 1) = \tfrac{1}{2} (9227465 - 1) = \tfrac{1}{2} \cdot 9227464 = 4613732 \]</p>
			<p>and this is our final answer.</p>

		<h2 id="problem-5"><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=5">5.- Smallest Multiple</a></h2>
		<p>\(2520\) is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from \(1\) to \(10\) without any remainder.</p>
		<p>What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from \(1\) to \(20\)?</p>
		
		<details>
			<summary>Solution</summary>	
			<p>This is simply the least common multiple of the numbers from \(1\) to \(20\). Let \(p_n\) be the \(n\)-th prime number. If we have numbers \(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_m \in \mathbb N\) which we factorize as \(a_k = p_1^{\alpha_k^{(1)}} p_2^{\alpha_k^{(2)}} p_3^{\alpha_k^{(3)}} \cdots \) for certain  (finitely non-zero) \(\alpha_k^{(1)},\alpha_k^{(2)},\dots \in \mathbb N\), we have that the least common multiple of \(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_m\) is given by</p>
			<p>\[ \mathrm{lcm}(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_m) = \prod_{n=1}^\infty p_n^{\max_{k=1}^m \alpha_k^{(n)}}. \]</p>
			<p>That is, we take the highest exponent of each prime number in the factorizations of \(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_m\). The greatest common divisor follows a similar formula, where we take the lowest exponents instead. Therefore, we need to factorize the numbers from \(1\) to \(20\) and find these largest exponents. In the following table, each row represents a prime number and each cell represents the exponent of that prime number found in the factorization of the column's number. We've left a blank cell instead of writing zeroes. At the right, we have the largest exponent of each row. </p>

			<p>Therefore, the number we are looking for is</p>

		<h2 id="problem-6"><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=6">6.- Sum Square Difference</a></h2>
		<p>The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,</p>
		<p>\[1^2+2^2+\cdots+10^2 = 358.\]</p>
		<p>The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
		<p>\[(1+2+\cdots+10)^2 = 3025.\]</p>
		<p>Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is \(3025-385\).</p>
		<p>Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.</p>
		
		<details>
			<summary>Solution</summary>	
			<p>The sum of the first \(n\) numbers is given by the triangular number formula \( \sum_{k=1}^n k = \frac{n (n+1)}{2} \). On the other hand, the sum of the squares of the first \(n\) numbers has a similar but slightly more complicated formula:</p>
			<p>\[ 1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2 = \sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = \frac{n (n+1) (2n+1)}{6}. \]</p>
			<p>Therefore, the difference between the sum of squares and the square of the sum of the first \(n\) numbers is given by</p>
			<p>\begin{align*}
				\left( \sum_{k=1}^n k \right)^2 - \sum_{k=1}^n k^2 & = \left( \frac{n (n+1)}{2} \right)^2 - \frac{n (n+1)(2n+1)}{6} = \\
				& = \tfrac{1}{12} (3 n^2 (n+1)^2 - 2 n (n+1) (2n+1)) = \\
				& = \frac{n(n+1)}{12}(3n(n+1) - 2(2n+1)) = \\
				& = \frac{n(n+1)}{12}(3n^2 +3n - 4n - 2) = \\
				& = \frac{n (n+1) (3n^2 - n - 2)}{12} = \frac{n (n+1)(3n+2)(n-1)}{12}.
			\end{align*}</p>
			<p>So, substituting with \(n=100\), we obtain</p>
			<p>\[\frac{100 \cdot 101 \cdot 302 \cdot 99}{12} = \frac{301969800}{12} = 25164150, \]</p>
			<p>which is our final answer.</p>

		<h2 id="problem-9"><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=9">9.- Special Pythagorean Triplet</a></h2>
		<p>A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, \(a < b < c\), for which,</p>
		<p>\[a^2+b^2=c^2\]</p>
		<p>For example, \(3^2+4^2 = 9+16=25=5^2\).</p>
		<p>There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which \(a+b+c=1000\).</p>
		<p>Find the product \(abc\).</p>
		
		<details>
			<summary>Solution</summary>	
			<p>Every Pythagorean triplet can be written as</p>
			<p>\[ (a,b,c) = (d (m^2-n^2),2 d m n, d (m^2+n^2)) \]</p>
			for some \(d,m,n \in \mathbb N\) with \(m > n\). If we assume that \(d\), \(m\) and \(n\) are such numbers (we dont't know if \(d (m^2-n^2)\) corresponds to \(a\) or \(b\), but we do know that \(c = d (m^2+n^2) \)), we have that</p>
			<p>\[ a+b+c = d(m^2-n^2) + 2 dmn + d(m^2 + n^2) = 2 d m^2 + 2 d m n = 1000 \Longrightarrow d m(m + n) = 500 \]</p>
			<p>We can write \(d m (m+n) = 500 = 2^2 \cdot 5^3\). This number doesn't have many divisors, only twelve, so we can check them one by one. All the possible divisors of \(500\) and therefore values of \(d\) and \(m\) are \(1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, 500\). Some combinations of \(d\) and \(m\) with these values are not valid, since \(d m\) would stop being a divisor of \(500\). For example, \(d = 20\) and \(m = 2\) would give \(dm = 40\), which is not a divior of \(500\). Checking all the valid choices of \(d\) and \(m\), we obtain the corresponding values of \(n = 500/(dm) - m\):</p>

			\end{array}</p>
			<p>Here each column corresponds to a value of \(m\) and each row to a value of \(d\). Marked in red are the only two combinations such that \(m > n > 0\). Both give the same triplet, since if \(d=1\), \(m=20\) and \(n = 5\), we have</p>
			<p>\[ a = d (m^2-n^2) = 1 \cdot (20^2-5^2) = 375, \quad b = 2 d m n = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 20 \cdot 5 = 200, \quad c = d (m^2 + n^2) = 1 \cdot(20^2 + 5^2) = 425, \] </p>
			<p>and if \(d=25\), \(m=4\) and \(n=1\), we have</p>
			<p>\[ a = d (m^2-n^2) = 25 \cdot (4^2-1^2) = 375, \quad b = 2 d m n = 2 \cdot 25 \cdot 4 \cdot 1 = 200, \quad c = d (m^2 + n^2) = 25 \cdot(4^2 + 1^2) = 425 \] </p>
			<p>These three numbers clearly have \(a+b+c = 500\) and \(a^2 + b^2 = 180625 = c^2 \). Therefore, our answer is</p>
			<p>\[ a b c = 375 \cdot 200 \cdot 425 = 31875000 \]</p>

		<h2 id="problem-15"><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=15">15.- Lattice Paths</a></h2>
		<p>Starting in the top left corner of a \(2 \times 2\) grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly routes to the bottom right corner.</p>
		<img src="https://projecteuler.net/resources/images/0015.png?1678992052" />
		<p>How many such routes are there through a \(20 \times 20\) grid?</p>
		
		<details>
			<summary>Solution</summary>	
			In a \(n \times n\) grid, to go to from the top left corner to the bottom right corner, we must always move \(n\) steps to the right and \(n\) steps down according to the constraints of this problem. Therefore, a path depeds only on which order we take these steps. For example, in the image, the top left path follows the ordering <i>right right down down</i> and the bottom middle path follows <i>down right down right</i>.</p>
			
			<p>For each possible ordering of these steps there is one path; and for each possible path there is one order. Choosing a path and choosing an ordering is equivalent. Therefore the number of possible routes on a \(n \times n\) grid is the number of possible orders to be chosen. In this choice, we must choose to place \(n\) steps down and \(n\) steps right in a sequence of \(2n\) steps, so this number of choices is given by the combination formula \( \binom{2n}{n} = \frac{(2n)!}{n! n!} \). Therefore, we have that the number of possible routes in a \(20 \times 20\) grid is</p>
			<p>\[ \binom{40}{20} = \frac{40!}{20! 20!} = \frac{21 \cdot 22 \cdot \cdots \cdot 40}{1 \cdot 2 \cdot \cdots \cdot 20} = 137846528820 \]</p>

		<h2 id="problem-24"><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=24">24.- Lexicographic Permutations</a></h2>
		<p>A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:</p>
		<p style="text-align: center">012   021   102   120   201   210</p>
		<p>What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?</p>
		
		<details>
			<summary>Solution</summary>	
			<p>When considering the permutations of \(n\) digits, there is a total of \(n!\) permutations and \((n-1)!\) permutations that start by each digit. The first \((n-1)!\) permutations start with \(0\), the next \((n-1)!\) start with \(1\), and so on.</p>
			<p>Considering that the permutations start at the \(0\)th place, we have to find the \(999999\)th permutation. We can find the representation of this permutation using the following algorithm:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> To find the first digit of the \(m\)-th permutation, write \(m = a \cdot (n-1)! + b \) with \(a,b \in \mathbb N\) and \(b < (n-1)!\). The first digit of the permutation will be \(a\).
				<li> Cross out \(a\) off your list of reminding digits.
				<li> The second digit of the \(m\)-th permutation will be the first digit of the \(b\)-th permutation of the reminding digits. In fact, the rest of the permutation you haven't found is the \(b\)-th permutation of the reminding digits.
				<li> Repeat until you've found all digits.
			</ul>
			<p>For example, to find the third, permutation of the digits \(0\), \(1\) and \(2\), we write \(2 = 1 \cdot (3-1)! + 0 \) (remember, we use \(2\) instead of \(3\) because we start at the \(0\)th permutation). Then, the first digit of our permutation will be \(1\). The second digit will be the first digit of the \(0\)th permutation of \(0\) and \(2\), so we write \(0 = 0 \cdot (2-1)! + 0\) and the second digit is \(0\). The only remaining digit is \(2\), which is also the \(0\)th permutation of the digit \(2\). Therefore, the third permutation of \(0\), \(1\) and \(2\) is \(102\), as we see in the problem statement.</p>
			<p>Let's repeat this process but for \(9\) digits and the \(999999\)th permutation:</p>
			<p>\begin{array}{c|ccc|c}
				n & (n-1)! & m = a \cdot (n-1)! + b & \text{digit} & 0123456789 \\ \hline

		<p>The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:</p>

		<p>\[F_2 = 1\]</p>
		<p>\[F_3 = 2\]</p>
		<p>\[F_4 = 3\]</p>
		<p>\[F_5 = 5\]</p>

		<p>\[F_{11} = 89\]</p>
		<p>\[F_{12} = 144\]</p>
		<p>The \(12\)th term, \(F_{12}\), is the first term to contain three digits.</p>
		<p>What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain \(1000\) digits?</p>
		
		<details>
			<summary>Solution</summary>	
			<p>If \(\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt 5}{2} \approx 1.618\) is the golden ratio, Binet's formula tells us that</p>
			<p>\[ F_n = \frac{\phi^n - \left( 1 - \phi \right)^n}{\sqrt 5}, \]</p>
			<p>where \(1 - \phi = \frac{-1}{\phi} = \frac{1 - \sqrt 5}{2} \approx -0.618\). Since \(1-\phi \in (-1,1)\), we have that \( \lim_{n \to \infty} (1-\phi)^n = 0 \). In fact, this term is negligible and we can consider the approximation \(F_n \approx \phi^n / \sqrt 5\), which will only get better as \(n\) grows. In fact, already at \(n=4\) we have that \(\phi^4 / \sqrt 5 \approx 3.0652 \approx 3 = F_4\).</p>
			<p>Now, any number \(m \in \mathbb N\) with \(d\) digits has that \(10^{d-1} \leq m < 10^d\), so \(d-1 \leq \log_{10} m < d\). On the other hand, we have that</p>
			<p>\[ \log_{10} F_n \approx \log_{10}\left(\frac{\phi^n}{\sqrt 5}\right) = n \log_{10} \phi - \tfrac{1}{2} \log_{10} 5. \]</p>
			<p>Therefore, if \(F_n\) has \(d\) digits, we have that, for large enough values of \(n\),</p>
			<p>\[ d-1 \leq n \log_{10} \phi - \tfrac{1}{2} \log_{10} 5 < d \]</p>
			and so,
			<p>\[ \frac{d-1 + \tfrac{1}{2} \log_{10} 5}{\log_{10} \phi} \leq n < \frac{d + \tfrac{1}{2} \log_{10} 5}{\log_{10} \phi}. \] <p>
			<p>Using this formula, we can find the first integer value of \(n\) immediately above \(\frac{d-1 + \tfrac{1}{2} \log_{10} 5}{\log_{10} \phi}\) to find the first Fibonacci number with \(d\) digits. For example, using \(d = 3\), we obtain</p>
			<p>\[ \frac{d-1 + \tfrac{1}{2} \log_{10} 5}{\log_{10} \phi} = \frac{2 + \tfrac{1}{2} \log_{10} 5}{\log_{10} \phi} \approx 11.24, \]</p>
			<p>so the first Fibonacci number with \(3\) digits is the \(12\)th one, as the statement says. Using \(d = 1000\), we have</p>
			<p>\[ \frac{d-1 + \tfrac{1}{2} \log_{10} 5}{\log_{10} \phi} = \frac{999 + \tfrac{1}{2} \log_{10} 5}{\log_{10} \phi} \approx 4781.86, \]</p>
			<p>hence our final answer is that the first term to contain \(1000\) digits is the \(4782\)th one.</p>
